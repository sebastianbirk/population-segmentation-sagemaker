# Population Segmentation using PCR and K-Means with Amazon Sagemaker

This repository contains code to train and deploy a PCR and K-Means model with Amazon sagemaker to segment the US population based on US census data.

## General Project Outline

1. Data loading and exploration
2. Data cleaning and pre-processing
3. Dimensionality reduction with PCA
4. Feature engineering and data transformation
5. Clustering transformed data with k-means
6. Extracting trained model attributes and visualizing k clusters\n",

These tasks make up a complete machine learning workflow from data loading and cleaning to model deployment.
